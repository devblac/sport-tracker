# Template Preview Fix Test

## Issue Description
Templates were leading to empty pages instead of showing exercise lists when clicked from the main Workout page.

## Root Cause
The `Workout.tsx` page was trying to navigate to `/workout-templates/${template.id}`, but this route doesn't exist in the routing configuration. Only `/workout-templates` exists.

## Solution Implemented
Changed the template selection behavior in `Workout.tsx` to match the working behavior in `WorkoutTemplates.tsx`:

1. **Added state management**: Added `selectedTemplate` state to track which template is being previewed
2. **Added TemplateDetail import**: Imported the `TemplateDetail` component that shows exercise lists
3. **Updated template selection**: Changed `onSelectTemplate` to set the selected template instead of navigating
4. **Added template detail view**: When a template is selected, show the `TemplateDetail` component with exercise list
5. **Added close functionality**: Added ability to close the template detail and return to main view
6. **Fixed workout creation**: Maintained the ability to start workouts from templates

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added imports and state
```typescript
import { TemplateDetail } from '@/components/workouts/TemplateDetail';
import type { WorkoutTemplate } from '@/schemas/workout';

const [selectedTemplate, setSelectedTemplate] = useState<WorkoutTemplate | null>(null);
```

### 2. Updated template selection logic
```typescript
const handleTemplateSelect = (template: WorkoutTemplate) => {
  setSelectedTemplate(template);
};
```

### 3. Added conditional rendering
```typescript
return (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    {selectedTemplate ? (
      /* Template Detail View */
      <div className="max-w-md mx-auto bg-background min-h-screen">
        <TemplateDetail
          template={selectedTemplate}
          onStartWorkout={handleStartWorkoutFromDetail}
          onClose={handleCloseDetail}
        />
      </div>
    ) : (
      /* Main workout view */
      // ... existing content
    )}
  </div>
);
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks on a template in the main Workout page
2. Template detail view opens showing the exercise list
3. User can see all exercises with set counts and muscle groups
4. User can click "START WORKOUT" to begin the workout
5. User can click back button to return to template list

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Workout.tsx`: Fixed template selection and preview functionality

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to the main Workout page
2. Click on any template in the Templates section
3. Verify that the template detail view opens
4. Verify that the exercise list is displayed with proper information
5. Verify that the "START WORKOUT" button works
6. Verify that the back button returns to the main view

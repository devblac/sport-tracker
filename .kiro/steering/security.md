# Security & Privacy Guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization

### Current Implementation Status
- **Local Authentication**: Mock authentication service with demo user support
- **Guest Mode**: Offline-first guest users with limited privileges
- **Token Management**: Mock JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Role-Based Access**: Basic, premium, and guest user roles

### Security Requirements

#### Authentication
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs MUST be validated using Zod schemas
- **Password Security**: Minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, special chars
- **Session Management**: Implement proper token expiration and refresh
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement login attempt limits (future backend requirement)

#### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Enforce user roles (guest, basic, premium)
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access their own data
- **API Permissions**: Validate user permissions before data operations
- **Guest Limitations**: Guest users cannot access social features or cloud sync

## Data Protection & Privacy

### Personal Data Handling
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary fitness and profile data
- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data stored locally with encryption (future requirement)
- **Data Anonymization**: Remove PII from analytics and logs
- **User Consent**: Explicit consent for data collection and sharing

### Privacy Controls
- **Profile Visibility**: Users control who can see their profile (public/friends/private)
- **Workout Sharing**: Granular control over workout data sharing
- **Social Features**: Opt-in for friend requests and social interactions
- **Data Export**: Users can export their data (GDPR compliance)

## Frontend Security

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Zod Validation**: All forms and API inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content before display
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (backend requirement)
- **File Upload**: Validate file types and sizes for profile images

### Client-Side Security
- **Environment Variables**: Only use VITE_ prefixed vars for client-side
- **API Keys**: Never expose secret keys in frontend code
- **Local Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data before storing locally
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers for XSS protection

## API Security (Future Backend Integration)

### Supabase Integration
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enable RLS on all tables
- **API Authentication**: Use Supabase auth tokens for API calls
- **Database Permissions**: Restrict database access by user role
- **Real-time Security**: Secure real-time subscriptions with proper filters

### API Best Practices
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications over HTTPS
- **Request Validation**: Validate all incoming requests
- **Response Sanitization**: Clean response data before sending
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive info in error messages

## Social Features Security

### Friend System
- **Privacy by Default**: Private profiles by default
- **Consent Required**: Explicit consent for friend requests
- **Block/Report**: Users can block and report inappropriate behavior
- **Data Sharing**: Control what data is shared with friends

### Leaderboards & Competitions
- **Opt-in Participation**: Users choose to participate in public leaderboards
- **Data Anonymization**: Option to participate anonymously
- **Fair Play**: Implement anti-cheating measures for competitions
- **Content Moderation**: Monitor and moderate user-generated content

## Development Security Practices

### Code Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of npm packages
- **Static Analysis**: Use ESLint security rules
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for sensitive features

### Environment Security
- **Environment Separation**: Separate dev/staging/production environments
- **Access Control**: Limit production access to authorized personnel
- **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activities and security breaches

## Compliance & Regulations

### GDPR Compliance
- **Data Subject Rights**: Right to access, rectify, erase, and port data
- **Consent Management**: Clear consent mechanisms for data processing
- **Data Breach Notification**: Procedures for handling data breaches
- **Privacy by Design**: Build privacy into system architecture

### Security Headers
```typescript
// Required security headers for production
{
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
}
```

## Security Checklist for New Features

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Identify what personal data is collected/processed
- [ ] Determine appropriate privacy controls
- [ ] Plan input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Consider authorization requirements
- [ ] Review potential security vulnerabilities

### During Development
- [ ] Implement proper input validation with Zod
- [ ] Add appropriate authorization checks
- [ ] Sanitize user-generated content
- [ ] Use secure coding practices
- [ ] Add security-focused tests

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Security code review
- [ ] Penetration testing (for critical features)
- [ ] Privacy impact assessment
- [ ] Update privacy policy if needed
- [ ] Monitor for security issues post-deployment

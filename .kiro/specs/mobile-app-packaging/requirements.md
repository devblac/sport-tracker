# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on packaging the existing PWA fitness tracker app into a native Android APK using Capacitor, preparing it for Google Play Store deployment. The app already has a solid PWA foundation with offline capabilities, gamification features, and Supabase integration that needs to be wrapped for mobile distribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to install the app from Google Play Store, so that I can access it like any other native mobile app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is packaged with Capacitor THEN it SHALL generate a valid Android APK
2. WHEN the APK is installed on Android devices THEN it SHALL launch and function identically to the PWA
3. WHEN users interact with the app THEN it SHALL maintain all existing features including offline functionality
4. WHEN the app accesses device features THEN it SHALL request appropriate permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Capacitor properly, so that the app integrates seamlessly with Android platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Capacitor is configured THEN it SHALL include necessary plugins for device features
2. WHEN the app uses native features THEN it SHALL handle permissions gracefully
3. WHEN building for production THEN it SHALL optimize bundle size and performance
4. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL initialize Supabase connection properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prepare the app for Google Play Store submission, so that it meets all store requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the APK is generated THEN it SHALL be signed with proper certificates
2. WHEN the app metadata is configured THEN it SHALL include proper app name, version, and descriptions
3. WHEN the app icons are configured THEN it SHALL include all required icon sizes and formats
4. WHEN the app permissions are declared THEN it SHALL only request necessary permissions
5. WHEN the app is built THEN it SHALL target appropriate Android API levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mobile app to work offline, so that I can track workouts without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is offline THEN it SHALL continue to function with cached data
2. WHEN internet connection is restored THEN it SHALL sync data with Supabase
3. WHEN using offline features THEN it SHALL maintain data integrity
4. WHEN the app updates THEN it SHALL handle cache invalidation properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up proper build and deployment pipeline, so that I can efficiently release updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN it SHALL use optimized build configuration
2. WHEN generating APK THEN it SHALL include proper versioning
3. WHEN deploying updates THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN building THEN it SHALL validate all required assets and configurations

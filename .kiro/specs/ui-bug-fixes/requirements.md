# Requirements Document - UI/UX Bug Fixes

## Introduction

The Sport Tracker fitness app has several critical UI/UX bugs that affect user experience, particularly in the authentication flow and design system consistency. These bugs include authentication service errors, duplicate UI elements, inconsistent theming, and components that don't follow the established design system. This spec addresses these issues to ensure a polished, consistent user experience across all features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Service Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log in successfully without encountering JavaScript errors, so that I can access my account and use the app's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to log in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully without throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
2. WHEN the authentication service processes login requests THEN it SHALL properly handle the response object structure
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages to the user
4. WHEN I log in successfully THEN I SHALL be redirected to the appropriate dashboard or home page
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all dependent components SHALL update correctly

### Requirement 2: Password Visibility Toggle Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single, properly positioned password visibility toggle, so that I can show/hide my password without visual confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the login form THEN I SHALL see only one password visibility toggle icon
2. WHEN I view the registration form THEN I SHALL see only one password visibility toggle icon
3. WHEN I click the password toggle THEN it SHALL properly show/hide the password text
4. WHEN the toggle is active THEN it SHALL display the correct visual state (eye vs eye-slash)
5. WHEN I interact with the toggle THEN it SHALL not interfere with form submission or validation

### Requirement 3: Design System Consistency for Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want all authentication UI elements to follow the app's design system and respect my theme preferences, so that the interface feels cohesive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the "OR Continue as Guest" section THEN it SHALL use proper design system styling and typography
2. WHEN I have dark theme selected THEN all authentication elements SHALL respect the dark theme colors
3. WHEN I have light theme selected THEN all authentication elements SHALL respect the light theme colors
4. WHEN I view authentication forms THEN all buttons, inputs, and text SHALL follow the established design tokens
5. WHEN I navigate between login and registration THEN the visual consistency SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 4: Schedule Creation Modal Design System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the schedule creation modal to follow the app's design system and theme preferences, so that it feels like a native part of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Create My Schedule" in the Progress section THEN the modal SHALL open with proper design system styling
2. WHEN I have dark theme enabled THEN the schedule modal SHALL respect dark theme colors and styling
3. WHEN I have light theme enabled THEN the schedule modal SHALL respect light theme colors and styling
4. WHEN I interact with modal elements THEN they SHALL use consistent typography, spacing, and component styles
5. WHEN I close the modal THEN it SHALL animate properly and return focus appropriately

### Requirement 5: Progress Section Feature Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand whether the "Create My Schedule" feature should be available in the Progress section, so that the app's feature set is intentional and well-organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Progress section THEN the available features SHALL align with the section's purpose
2. WHEN schedule creation is available THEN it SHALL be properly integrated with progress tracking
3. WHEN I create a schedule THEN it SHALL connect meaningfully to my progress data
4. WHEN the feature is not intended for this section THEN it SHALL be moved to the appropriate location
5. WHEN features are reorganized THEN navigation and user flows SHALL remain intuitive

### Requirement 6: Global Theme Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want all components throughout the app to respect my selected theme, so that I have a consistent visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a theme THEN ALL components SHALL immediately reflect the theme choice
2. WHEN new modals or overlays appear THEN they SHALL inherit the current theme styling
3. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN theme consistency SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN components are dynamically loaded THEN they SHALL apply the correct theme variables
5. WHEN I refresh the page THEN my theme preference SHALL persist and apply correctly

### Requirement 7: Form Component Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all form components to use standardized implementations, so that bugs like duplicate elements don't occur and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form components are implemented THEN they SHALL use shared, reusable component patterns
2. WHEN password inputs are used THEN they SHALL use a single, standardized password input component
3. WHEN form validation occurs THEN it SHALL use consistent validation patterns and error display
4. WHEN forms are styled THEN they SHALL inherit from centralized design system tokens
5. WHEN new forms are added THEN they SHALL follow established component patterns

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur and helpful guidance for resolving issues, so that I can successfully complete my intended actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN I SHALL see user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN I SHALL see clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN I SHALL be informed about connectivity problems
4. WHEN I encounter bugs THEN the app SHALL gracefully handle errors without breaking the user experience
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN success feedback SHALL be provided to confirm the action completed

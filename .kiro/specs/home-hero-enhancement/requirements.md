# Home Hero Section Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Home screen hero section consists of a basic text greeting and a simple streak counter card. While functional, it lacks visual appeal and doesn't create the motivational impact needed to engage users when they first open the app. This enhancement will transform the hero section into a dynamic, visually stunning area that motivates users and showcases their progress in an engaging way.

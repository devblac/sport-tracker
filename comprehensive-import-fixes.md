# Comprehensive Import Fixes Applied

## Problem
Vite's stricter ES module resolution exposed issues with type re-exports from barrel files (`@/types`, `@/stores`). CRA was more forgiving with these patterns.

## Root Cause
The `src/types/index.ts` file was re-exporting types from schema files, but Vite couldn't resolve these re-exports properly, causing runtime errors like:
- `The requested module '/src/types/index.ts' does not provide an export named 'FitnessLevel'`
- `The requested module '/src/schemas/user.ts' does not provide an export named 'UserRole'`

## Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. User Schema Types
**Fixed files importing from `@/types` → `@/schemas/user`:**
- `src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` - FitnessLevel
- `src/components/auth/OnboardingFlow.tsx` - FitnessLevel, DayOfWeek  
- `src/pages/DevTest.tsx` - UserRole
- `src/services/AuthService.ts` - User, UserLogin, UserRegistration
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.ts` - User, UserProfile, UserSettings

### 2. Exercise Schema Types  
**Fixed files importing from `@/types` → `@/schemas/exercise`:**
- `src/data/sampleExercises.ts` - ExerciseCreate
- `src/services/ExerciseService.ts` - Exercise, ExerciseFilter, ExerciseCreate, ExerciseUpdate
- `src/hooks/useExercises.ts` - Exercise, ExerciseFilter
- `src/pages/ExerciseBrowser.tsx` - Exercise, ExerciseFilter
- `src/pages/ExerciseDetailPage.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/pages/ExerciseTest.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseAboutTab.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseCard.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseChartsTab.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseDetail.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseHistoryTab.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseList.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseRecordsTab.tsx` - Exercise
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseSearch.tsx` - ExerciseFilter, ExerciseCategory, BodyPart, Equipment, DifficultyLevel

### 3. Workout Schema Types
**Fixed files importing from `@/types` → `@/schemas/workout`:**
- `src/components/workouts/__tests__/WorkoutPlayer.integration.test.tsx` - Workout

### 4. Store Type Exports
**Fixed files importing types from `@/stores` → direct imports:**
- `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` - Toast type from `@/stores/useUIStore`

### 5. Utility Files
**Fixed relative imports:**
- `src/utils/userRoles.ts` - UserRole from `../schemas/user` → `@/schemas/user`

## Strategy Used
1. **Direct imports over re-exports**: Import types directly from their schema source files
2. **Type-only imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports to be explicit
3. **Consistent patterns**: All user types from `@/schemas/user`, exercise types from `@/schemas/exercise`, etc.

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates Vite module resolution errors
- ✅ More explicit about where types come from
- ✅ Better tree-shaking and build performance
- ✅ Clearer dependency relationships

## Files That Remain Using Barrel Exports
Store hooks (not types) still use `@/stores` which is fine:
- `useAuthStore` from `@/stores`
- `useUIStore` from `@/stores`

These work because they're importing actual functions/hooks, not re-exported types.

## Total Files Fixed: 25+
This comprehensive fix should resolve all the module resolution issues when switching from CRA to Vite.
